    <!-- Part 8; Create a list with links to two interactive visualizations -->
    <h3 >  List of two interactive visualizations (IV) </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://www.windy.com/55.687/12.570?55.574,12.469,10,m:fdXagv6">
            IV1: Wind map Copenhagen (Windy.com)</a> </li>
        <li> <a href="http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?map=map00061&show_description=show">
            IV2: Metabolic Pathways map (Genome.jp)</a> </li>

    </ul>

    <!-- Part 8; Describe both positive and negative aspects of the previous IVs-->
    <div id="part_8" style="vertical-align:middle; text-align:center;padding-top: 3em;">
        <h3 align="left">  Positive and negative aspects of the previous IVs </h3>
        <p align="left">
            We found a really nice interactive data representation called Windy.com (IV1 on the list)
            It's a world map overlaid by wind direction and speed.<br>
            It's easy, intuitive and very clear, however it contains tons of options.<br>
            The arrows show direction and the color show speed.<br>
            Otherwise it works just like google maps. For more detailed information about an specific location: <br>
            just click on a point in the map.<br>
        </p>

        <p align="left">
            We found a bad example within the page genome.jp (IV2 on the list) <br>
            They are metabolic interaction pathways depicted by lines and nodes with names. All the nodes are links to other pages.<br>
            All the lines show the connections of each node.<br>
            The main downside of this IV is that it is very cluttered and therefore is really time consuming
            to try to look up something specificly. This IV could be improved by <br>
            adding some interactivity and reducing complexity.

            <li>I would like to visualize word relational data. For instance the frequency of word occurence and the relation<br>
                to other words in the same text. Optionally, relations focused on a user submitted keyword.</li>
            <li>Preferably, it would display, in one look, the general content of a text.</li>

            a) What type of data would you like to visualize, and where would you get access to this data? <br>
            I would like to visualize an interface with medical information related to Alzheimer's disease. <br>
            The data would be obtain from some web-page, in particular of some yet unknown study. In case of not finding <br>
            a proper dataset, the professor will be asked. <br>

            b) What story would the combination of text and visualization tell? <br>
            The webpage is intended to provide a source of alzheimer's information and pre-diagnosis of alzheimer's disease.<br>
            The story would be that a relative suspects that somebody around suffers from alzheimer disease, <br>
            then the patient would complete a quick image-based test and afterwards and depending on the answers some useful
            information about Alzheimer's disease would pop-up. Furthermore, some information about the patient <br>
            would be introduced and added to a internal database. <br>
            c)Who is the intended audience?  <br>
            The intended audience would be people who wants to quickly check if somebody has Alzheimer's.  <br>
            d) Draw a sketch.  <br>
